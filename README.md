## Crop-Recommendation Final Year Project

Developed a Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning and IoT
Designed and implemented an IoT sensor network to collect real-time environmental data (soil moisture, temperature, humidity) using ESP8266 NodeMCUs.
Employed Machine Learning techniques to analyze sensor data and generate crop recommendations based on historical yield data and environmental conditions.
Built a user-friendly web interface using Flask to display crop recommendations and relevant information to farmers.
This project aimed to increase crop yields, optimize resource usage, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
